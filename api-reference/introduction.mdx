## Welcome to StackSee API

StackSee provides a powerful REST API for analyzing websites and extracting technology stack information. Discover what frameworks, libraries, hosting providers, and technologies any website uses with a single API call.

## Base URL

```
https://api.stacksee.com
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request header:

```bash
X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
```

You can obtain your API key from the [StackSee Dashboard](https://dashboard.stacksee.com).

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.stacksee.com/api/v1/domain/analyze \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "deepScan": false
  }'
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited based on your subscription plan:

- **Free Tier**: 100 requests per day
- **Pro Tier**: 1,000 requests per day
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

Rate limit information is included in the response headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Timestamp when the rate limit resets

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses include the analyzed data, while errors include descriptive error messages.

### Success Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // Analysis results
  }
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid request data",
  "message": "URL is required"
}
```
