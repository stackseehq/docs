</Step>

<Step title="Make your first request">
  Use the analyze endpoint to scan a website. Here's a simple example:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.stacksee.com/api/v1/domain/analyze \
    -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "deepScan": false
    }'
  ```

  <Tip>
  Start with `deepScan: false` for faster results. Enable deep scanning when you need comprehensive analysis.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the response">
  The API returns detailed information about the website's technology stack:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "technologies": [...],
      "frameworks": [...],
      "hosting": {...},
      "branding": {
